# Capture PNG Screenshots 

This is a simple Automator workflow for MAC OS X that allows you to capture screenshots in the PNG format. You can add it as a service or export it to a standalone app and easy access via spotlight.

[Grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grab_(software)) app is fine, but it kind of forces you to save things in the TIFF format. This solves that problem by creating screenshots directly in PNG. 

Currently it triggers a dialog to capture a selection screenshot rather than a full window. It then saves it to your /tmp folder with a timestamped filename.
